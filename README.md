Description✅:

Welcome to the Food Ordering App repository! This project utilizes React Native Expo along with TypeScript to build a dynamic and user-friendly mobile application for ordering food. Leveraging Supabase as the database solution and Clerk for authentication, this app offers robust functionality including multi-user handling with distinct roles such as admin and regular user.

Features:

1,) User Authentication 🔓: Utilizes Clerk for secure and seamless user authentication, ensuring each user's identity is verified before accessing the app's features.

2.) Role-based Access Control 📝: Implements multi-user handling with different roles, distinguishing between admins and regular users. Admins have access to privileged actions such as managing menu items, viewing orders, and user management, while regular users can place orders and view their order history.

3.) Menu Management 📃: Admins can effortlessly manage the menu by adding, updating, or removing items, ensuring that the available options are always up-to-date.

4.) Order Placement 🍇: Users can browse through the menu, select items, customize their orders, and place them securely. Real-time updates ensure users receive immediate feedback on their orders.

5.) Admin Dashboard 📊: An intuitive dashboard for admins to monitor and manage orders, track sales, view user data, and perform administrative tasks efficiently.

6.) Responsive Design 🥳: Built using React Native Expo, the app offers a seamless experience across various devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
